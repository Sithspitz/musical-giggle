####### T-SNE Master Scripts #########

## Background ##
These T-SNE scripts were originally written by Jonathan Irish and his group 
- See: JonathanIrish/datasci_london
- Also see: cytolab/mem

My scripts are adopted from their originals.

rtsne() used to T-SNE the samples.
FlowSOM clustering (or another clustering algorithm) applied to create clusters from the islands.
And Marker Enrichment Modelling (MEM) used to relatively quantitate marker expression to determine which cell population belongs in which cluster.

# Generic Scripts and Descriptions #
For adopting dependent on analysis and data.
